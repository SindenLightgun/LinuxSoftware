Use the following inf file if Windows 7 or 8 is not automatically picking up the Sinden
Lightgun software.  In this case you should have a SindenLightgun device with an error
against it in device manager, use this inf file.

You may need to disable driver signing in windows to achieve this.

If you are unable to update your lightgun firmware in the main Sinden Lightgun software
please install the drivers in FirmwareUpdateDrivers folder which installs a driver pack
that seems to resolve the issue.
